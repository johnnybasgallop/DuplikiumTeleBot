using uptimerobot how to set it up so it pings supabase once per week to stop it archiving the project as per the free tier

I'll help you set up UptimeRobot to ping your Supabase project weekly to prevent it from pausing due to inactivity on the free tier.

Here's how to configure this:

Step 1: Get Your Supabase Project URL
First, you'll need your Supabase project's REST API URL:

Go to your Supabase dashboard
Navigate to Settings → API
Copy your "Project URL" (usually looks like https://your-project-id.supabase.co)
Step 2: Set Up UptimeRobot Monitor
Log into UptimeRobot and click "Add New Monitor"
Configure the monitor settings:
Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
Friendly Name: "Supabase Weekly Keepalive" (or similar)
URL: Your Supabase project URL + /rest/v1/
Example: https://your-project-id.supabase.co/rest/v1/
Monitoring Interval: 10080 minutes (this equals 7 days/1 week)
Advanced Settings:
HTTP Method: GET
Request Headers: Add your Supabase anon key
apikey: your-supabase-anon-key
Authorization: Bearer your-supabase-anon-key
Request Body: Leave empty
Expected Status Code: 200
Step 3: Alternative Endpoints
If the basic REST endpoint doesn't work well, you can try these alternatives:

Option 1: Health check endpoint

https://your-project-id.supabase.co/rest/v1/
Option 2: Simple table query (if you have a public table)

https://your-project-id.supabase.co/rest/v1/your-table-name?limit=1
Option 3: Auth endpoint

https://your-project-id.supabase.co/auth/v1/settings
Important Notes:
Weekly interval: UptimeRobot's free tier allows intervals up to 5 minutes minimum, but you can set it to check weekly (10080 minutes) on paid plans. If you're on the free tier, you might need to use a third-party service or upgrade.
Authentication: Make sure to include your anon key in the headers, as most Supabase endpoints require authentication.
Monitor what matters: The goal is just to generate some activity, so even a simple REST API call should suffice.
If UptimeRobot's free tier doesn't support weekly intervals, you could alternatively use:

GitHub Actions with a scheduled workflow
Cron-job.org (free service that supports weekly intervals)
Render cron jobs or similar services
Would you like me to explain how to set up any of these alternatives instead?

where do i put the anon key

Looking at your screenshots, I can see you're getting the "No API key found in request" error, and you need to add the anon key in the Request headers section.

Here's exactly where to put it:

In the Request Headers Section:
First header:
X-Header-Name: apikey
Value: your-supabase-anon-key
Second header:
X-Header-Name: Authorization
Value: Bearer your-supabase-anon-key
To get your Supabase anon key:
Go to your Supabase dashboard
Navigate to Settings → API
Copy the anon/public key (it's a long string starting with eyJ...)
Complete setup:
URL: https://vnrimheruajfymaxqouj.supabase.co/rest/v1/
HTTP Method: Keep it as HEAD (as shown selected)
Request headers: Add both headers above with your actual anon key
The HEAD method is actually perfect for this use case since you just want to ping the server without transferring data - it's lighter than GET and will still keep your project active.

Make sure to replace your-supabase-anon-key with the actual key from your Supabase dashboard in both header values.

gonna just use this github action instead: name: Ping Supabase to Prevent Pausing

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * *1,4' # Runs at 9:00 AM UTC every Monday and Thursday
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering from the GitHub UI

jobs:
  ping:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Use Node.js 18

      # Step 3: Install Supabase Client
      - name: Install Supabase Client
        run: npm install @supabase/supabase-js --force

      # Step 4: Ping Supabase
      - name: Ping Supabase
        env:
          SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL }} # Supabase project URL
          SUPABASE_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }} # Supabase service role key
        run: |
          node -e "
          (async () => {
            try {
              // Debugging: Log environment variables (optional)
              console.log('Supabase URL:', process.env.SUPABASE_URL);
              console.log('Supabase Key:', process.env.SUPABASE_KEY);

              // Import Supabase client
              const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
              const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY);

              // Ping Supabase by querying a table (e.g., 'songs')
              const { data, error } = await supabase.from('your_table').select('*').limit(10);

              // Handle errors
              if (error) throw error;

              // Log success
              console.log('Ping successful:', data);
            } catch (err) {
              // Log and exit with error
              console.error('Error pinging Supabase:', err.message);
              process.exit(1);
            }
          })();
          "

That's a great solution! GitHub Actions is actually better than UptimeRobot for this use case since it's free and gives you more control. Your workflow looks solid, but here are a few suggestions to make it even better:

Improvements to consider:
Use anon key instead of service role key for better security:
yaml
SUPABASE_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
Remove the console.log of keys for security:
javascript
// Remove or comment out these lines:
// console.log('Supabase URL:', process.env.SUPABASE_URL);
// console.log('Supabase Key:', process.env.SUPABASE_KEY);
Add a simple health check option in case you don't want to query a specific table:
javascript
// Alternative: Simple auth check instead of table query
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
// OR just a simple select from any public table
Consider the cron schedule - your current schedule runs twice a week (Monday and Thursday at 9 AM UTC), which should be plenty to prevent pausing.
Setting up the secrets:
Make sure to add these to your GitHub repository secrets:

Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
Add:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: Your Supabase project URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Your Supabase anon/public key
The workflow will definitely work to keep your Supabase project active. Just make sure to replace 'your_table' with an actual table name from your database, or use the auth endpoint alternative I mentioned above.

how to setup the github action?

Here's how to set up the GitHub Action step by step:

Step 1: Create the Workflow File
Navigate to your GitHub repository
Create the workflow directory structure:
Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
In the filename field, type: .github/workflows/ping-supabase.yml
GitHub will automatically create the folders
Paste your workflow code into the file and commit it
Step 2: Set Up Repository Secrets
Go to your repository settings:
Click on "Settings" tab in your repo
In the left sidebar, click "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
Add your Supabase secrets:
Click "New repository secret"
Add these two secrets:
Secret 1:
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
Value: Your Supabase project URL (e.g., https://vnrimheruajfymaxqouj.supabase.co)
Secret 2:
Name: NEXT_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (or better: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
Value: Your Supabase anon key from Settings → API in your Supabase dashboard
Step 3: Update the Table Name
In your workflow file, replace 'your_table' with an actual table name from your database:

javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('songs').select('*').limit(1);
Step 4: Test the Workflow
Manual test:
Go to "Actions" tab in your GitHub repo
Click on your workflow "Ping Supabase to Prevent Pausing"
Click "Run workflow" button to test it manually
Check the logs:
After it runs, click on the workflow run to see the logs
Make sure it completes successfully
Step 5: Verify the Schedule
Your cron schedule '0 9 * * 1,4' means:

Runs at 9:00 AM UTC
Every Monday (1) and Thursday (4)
This should be plenty to keep your Supabase project active
File Structure Should Look Like:
your-repo/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ping-supabase.yml
└── (your other files)
The workflow will now run automatically on schedule and you can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab whenever needed!

                }

                console.log('✅ Supabase ping successful! Status:', response.status);
                console.log('Project will remain active.');
              } else {
                console.log('⚠️ Supabase responded with status:', response.status);
              }

            } catch (err) {
